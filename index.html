<p>
The goal of the project was to create a web-based open source graphics benchmark with HTML5 and WebGL using a testing metric other than frame rate. The project client was Remi Arnaud from AMD, and he proposed this project in order to experiment with a new format of GPU testing that the functionality of WebGL now gives us access to. The research and coding was done by Byron Kropf and Charles Lui, with guidance and supervision by Remi Arnaud.

This is a significant project because 3D graphics are becoming more and more prevalent, and our project provides a way to accurately measure the graphics performance on a device. The main benchmark in the project does not use the typical measurement, frames per second, to measure the graphical performance of the computer. Instead, it measures the amount of work that a device can do in the time period of a single frame. We cannot use frames per second as a measurement of graphics performance because it can be inaccurate in the context of a web browser; this is where the project comes into play. 

We accomplished our goal of prototyping a new way of benchmarking graphics performance in a web browser. In addition, when we started getting data out of our benchmark, the results supported the theoretical results that we were looking for, which was quite encouraging.

Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch: http://luic.github.io/WebGL-Performance-Benchmark/</p>

<p>For the most consistent benchmark results, don't run other intensive applications while attempting to benchmark your system. Also, switching web browser tabs while running the benchmark may affect your results due to the web browser changing the priority of the benchmark process.
