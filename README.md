WebGL Performance Benchmark
==========

To run the benchmarks, feel free to either download it onto your computer and run it with a WebGL capable browser, or visit: http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~luic/capstone/WebGL-Performance-Benchmark/benchmark/

For the most consistent benchmark results, don't run other intensive applications while attempting to benchmark your system. Also, switching web browser tabs while running the benchmark may affect your results due to the web browser changing the priority of the benchmark process.
